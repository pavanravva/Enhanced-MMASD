# Multimodal Transformer Framework

In this repository, we present a Multimodal Privacy-Preserving Dataset focused on play therapy interventions for children with ASD, along with a Multimodal Transformer Framework. The dataset comprises three types of data: 3D skeleton data, 3D body mesh data, and optical flow data, all extracted from video recordings of play therapy sessions between therapists and children with ASD. The framework is designed for two key tasks: action classification and ASD identification.
